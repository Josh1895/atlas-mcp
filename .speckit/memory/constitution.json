      "title": "Agent-MCP as Primary Orchestrator",
      "description": "Agent-MCP remains the primary conductor for task decomposition, dispatch, persistent memory, and result composition. Atlas Swarm is embedded as a solver strategy, not a separate product.",
      "rationale": "Maintains backward compatibility and leverages Agent-MCP's existing strengths in coordination while adding swarm capabilities.",
      "examples": [
        "All swarm runs are tracked in Agent-MCP's SQLite database",
        "Swarm results are automatically written back to task notes",
        "Existing Agent-MCP tools continue to work unchanged"

      "title": "Tests as Primary Oracle",
      "description": "In patch mode, tests are the primary correctness oracle. Patches are validated by running actual tests, not just by similarity matching. Behavioral clustering takes precedence over syntactic similarity when tests are available.",
      "rationale": "Behavioral correctness is more important than syntactic similarity. A passing test proves functionality.",
      "examples": [
        "Prefer passing behavioral cluster over larger syntactic cluster",
        "Always run test_command when provided",
        "Mark consensus_reached=true only for valid patches"

      "id": "P-003",
      "title": "Multi-Agent Consensus Over Single-Agent",
      "description": "Use diverse AI agents with different perspectives (prompt styles) to generate solutions, then use clustering + voting to select the best. Consensus improves robustness.",
      "rationale": "Diverse approaches reduce single-point-of-failure and improve solution quality through ensemble effects.",
      "examples": [
        "Use at least 5 agents with different prompt styles",
        "Wait for consensus (K votes ahead) before selecting",
        "Include SENIOR_ENGINEER, SECURITY_FOCUSED, PERFORMANCE_EXPERT styles"

      "title": "Feature-Flagged Rollout",
      "description": "All swarm functionality is gated behind feature flags. Existing Agent-MCP flows work unchanged when swarm mode is disabled.",
      "rationale": "Enables safe rollout, A/B testing, and immediate rollback if issues arise.",
      "examples": [
        "SWARM_ENABLED=false disables all swarm features",
        "Individual features (web, context7) can be toggled independently",
        "DB tables exist but are inert when swarm is disabled"

      "title": "Budget Enforcement",
      "description": "Every swarm run has hard limits on time, cost, tokens, and tool calls. Budget overruns trigger graceful best-effort results, never runaway costs.",
      "rationale": "Production systems must have predictable costs and latency. No runaway API calls.",
      "examples": [
        "Hard stop at max_cost_usd with best-effort result",
        "Timeout returns best consensus so far",
        "Early consensus via IncrementalVoter saves costs"
      ]

      "id": "P-006",
      "title": "Persistent Traceability",
      "description": "Every swarm run creates durable records: run metadata, agent outputs, cluster assignments, vote counts, tool calls. Full replay capability for evaluation.",
      "rationale": "Debugging, evaluation, and audit require complete history. Reproducibility enables golden tests.",
      "examples": [
        "swarm_runs table stores complete run metadata",
        "swarm_outputs stores every agent's raw output",
        "tool_calls logs every external tool invocation"

    "All async functions must handle cancellation gracefully",
