  "summary": "Integrate Atlas swarm capabilities into Agent-MCP by: (1) adding new DB tables for swarm persistence, (2) creating a swarm_tools.py module with run_swarm_consensus tool, (3) implementing SwarmManager that wraps Atlas components, (4) adding ToolRouter for managed tool access, (5) implementing BudgetManager for cost/time limits, and (6) building consensus engine that orchestrates clustering and voting.",

  "architecture_decisions": [
    "AD-001: Agent-MCP remains the only server; Atlas is embedded as a library, not a separate FastMCP server. This avoids port conflicts and simplifies deployment.",
    "AD-002: SwarmManager is the single orchestration class that coordinates AtlasAdapter, ConsensusEngine, ToolRouter, BudgetManager, and Persistence. Clean separation of concerns.",
    "AD-003: AtlasAdapter wraps Atlas classes (AgentPoolManager, VotingManager, SimilarityClustering) to isolate Agent-MCP from Atlas internals. Enables future Atlas upgrades without breaking integration.",
    "AD-004: ToolRouter implements policy enforcement, caching, rate limiting, and circuit breakers for all external tool calls. Single point of control.",
    "AD-005: RepoResolver supports both local (MCP_PROJECT_DIR) and remote (git clone) modes. Local mode is default for Agent-MCP compatibility.",
    "AD-006: Answer mode uses Agent-MCP's existing embedding infrastructure (via openai_service.py) for clustering, avoiding duplicate embedding providers.",
    "AD-007: All swarm DB operations go through execute_db_write to maintain serialized write semantics and avoid SQLite concurrency issues.",
    "AD-008: Structured logging uses run_id as correlation ID across all swarm operations for traceability."
